			I always have a hard time coming up with content for the homework assignments. 
			<br>
			<br>
			So I thought... Ok, I'll just use projects from other classes to fill this page up. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I feel like it adds richness and meaning to the homework.

			<h2>As an ASIDE... <br>
			Laney Homework</h2>
			<p>The header image is from a font I created for my final project in a Typography class at Laney College.<br><br>
				I named the font Busy Brown, my son's name, mostly because I couldn't think of anything else.<br><br>
				It is a fully usable font, and the Peace Sign and Yin Yang are glyph's within the font that correspond to unicode. In this instance, I saved the font as an image, to embed. I'd be interested in learning how to embed fonts one day!
