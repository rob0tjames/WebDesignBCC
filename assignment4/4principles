<h1> Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity </h1>

<p class="a">Below, I examine four websites, covering the four essential web design principles, as titled above.</p> 

<h2 class="a">Contrast</h2>
<a class="a" href="https://stopaapihate.org/"><strong>Stop AAPI Hate</strong> </a>
<ul>
<li>The Organization Stop AAPI Hate has good examples of Contrast</li>
<li>Most notably, the colors. The stark black and white, with the bright<br>
yellow really stand out.</li>
<li>The logo and body give contrast through type with a hand painted<br>
logo paired with a sans-serif font.</li>	
</ul>

<h2 class="a">Repetition</h2>
<a class="a" href="https://heyday.xyz/"><strong>Heyday</strong></a>
<ol>
<li>Heyday has a simple to navigate homepage, that shows repetition through<br>
	color and placement.</li>
<li>As you scroll through each section of information, colors alternate, and<br>
	while the colors themselves rarely repeat, the alternation forms a pattern,<br>
	which is an aspect of repetition in web design.  </li>
<li>With each alternating color, the content flips from side to side, usually<br>
	a picture on one side, and text on the other. Another form of repetition<br>
	at work</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="a">Alignment</h2>
<a class="a" href="https://www.wannabe.toys/category/all"><strong>Wannabe Toys Shop Page</strong></a>
<dl>
	<dt>Why Just the Shop Page?</dt>
	<dd>Well their whole site, in my opinion, actually shows off all 4 terms,<br>
	however I really enjoyed the shop.</dd>
	<br>
	<dt>Alignment as Organization</dt>
	<dd>The well designed grid organizes their toys in an easy to navigate and<br>
	absorb way.</dd>
	<br>
	<dt>Well Designed Alignment</dt>
	<dd>I used this example because I thought their approach made a simple grid<br> 
	alignment really aesthticaly pleasing, but at the same time it does not <br>
	distract from the content itself.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 class="a">Proximity</h2>
<a class="a" href="https://www.bhroovi.com/about"><strong>Bhroovi Gupta's About Page</strong></a>
<ol class="a">
<li>Bhroovi's site also features a lot of design elements, but I really enjoyed<br> 
	the proximity.</li>
<li>In particular, I thought her picture and her about me text was well balanced,<br>
	with the picture grabbing you first, and then naturally leading you to the words.<br>
	Contrast is also doing some good work here too. </li>
<li>The approximate similar size between the portrait and the body text, while<br>
	being centered within squares of color, feel like well hung art pieces in a <br>
	gallery or museum.</li>
</ol>

<h1> In Conclusion... </h1>
<p>
I noticed most websites that I got my examples from actually exhibited multiple design<br>
elements of the four that we learned in the assignment. It really helps one realize the<br>
importance of incorporating these into web design.</p>
