      <h2>Why Strawberry & Mint?</h2>
      <p>Well, the truth is that I just went to Adobe Color and messed around with a complimentary color wheel until I found something I liked. It turned out to be a nice pink and a nice green, Strawberry & Mint seemed to be a good description.</p>

          <h3>Pondering S & M</h3>
          <p> I don't know if I've ever had any sort of food that was a combination of Strawberry & Mint, if I did, it wasn't mind blowing enough for me to remember.

          <h3>More on S & M (lol)</h3>
          <p>Trying to think of what the flavor combo would entail, I can't decide if it would be delicious or disgusting. Also the more I think about it, strawberries aren't actually pink. I guess they could be in the center?</p>
